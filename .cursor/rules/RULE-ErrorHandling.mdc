Error Handling and Validation

Form Validation
- Implement proper error messages
- Use proper form libraries (e.g., React Hook Form)

Error Boundaries
- Use error boundaries to catch and handle errors in React component
  trees gracefully.
- Design user-friendly fallback UIs to display when errors occur,
  keeping users informed without breaking the app.

Additional Practices
- Classify errors as recoverable vs. fatal; surface actionable,
  user-friendly messages and avoid exposing raw error data.
- Log errors to monitoring/observability tooling with enough context
  (user action, route, payload shape) to debug safely.
- Add retries with backoff for transient failures and circuit breakers
  for chatty endpoints that degrade UX when unstable.
- Fail soft where possible: degrade non-critical features before
  blocking core user flows.
