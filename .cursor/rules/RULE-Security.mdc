Security

- Use DOMPurify for sanitizing HTML content.
- Avoid inline scripts and unsanitized HTML injection; rely on trusted
  templating and component rendering paths.
- Keep secrets out of client bundles: never embed tokens, private keys,
  or internal endpoints in client-side code or public configs.
- Validate and whitelist redirect targets and external URLs to prevent
  open-redirect or SSRF vectors.
- Prefer HTTP-only, secure cookies for auth; avoid storing sensitive
  tokens in localStorage.
