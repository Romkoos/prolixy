UI and Styling

- Apply composition patterns to create modular, reusable components.

Styling Guidelines
- Use CSS modules for styling
- Design with mobile-first, responsive principles for flexibility
  across devices.
- Maintain consistent spacing values to establish visual harmony.
- Define CSS variables for theme colors and spacing to support easy
  theming and maintainability.

Additional Practices
- Prefer design tokens over hard-coded values; centralize spacing,
  color, and typography scales.
- Provide accessible focus-visible styles; avoid removing outlines
  without a replacement.
- Use logical properties (margin-inline, padding-block) to support RTL
  and localization.
- Favor flex/grid layouts over absolute positioning; avoid `!important`
  and deep selectors that hinder overrides.
